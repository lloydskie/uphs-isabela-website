Ramones MIT College of Business and Accountancy Programs Offered Bachelor of Science in Business Administration major in Management Bachelor of Science in Business Administration major in Business Management (BSBA-M), also known as BSBA in Business Management, is a four year degree program designed to equip students with the concepts and principles of Business Management. The BSBA in Management program teaches students operations and processes that occur within an organization such as procurement, logistics, quality control, project management, manufacturing and marketing. The BSBA-M program is more specific compared to the generic BSBA curriculum, and focuses on the more authoritative aspects of business like planning business activities, organizing departments and employees, running departments, and generally managing an organization. Bachelor of Science in Accountancy The Bachelor of Science in Accountancy (BSA) program is composed of subjects in accounting (financial, public, managerial), audit, administration, business laws and taxation. Its primary focus is not limited to business subjects, but to other fields as well, such as banking and finance, government, social services, education, and more. The program also teaches students to integrate information technology concepts into business systems, in order to create a more systematic and organized way of storing business related data. As a student, you will be taught computerized accounting systems, and basic understanding of computer programming and auditing systems. The program also instills in students the importance of computational and communication skills both in written and oral English. The BS Accounting program is taught in a variety of teaching methods such as case analysis, individual and group reports, simulations, classroom discussions and guest lecturers. It also includes extensive exposures to business immersions (an internship where there is a probability that the company will hire/absorb you after graduation) and an on-the-job training that will provide you with the understanding of practical accountancy.

College of International Hospitality Management Programs Offered Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management is a four-year college course recommended for people who wants to have a career in the field of Tourism and Event Management. This course leads to expertise in management of tour-operating agencies, as well as other jobs in the tourism and hospitality sector. The BS in Tourism Management course consists of several CHED-mandated general subjects, while the focus of the study is on the administrative aspect of Tour Operating business, particularly entrepreneurship and trade planning. The curriculum also includes operational competencies, event management classes, investment, market study and more. The combination of theories learned inside the classroom and on-the-job training will prepare the students to be globally competitive in tourism management operations. In comparison with BS in Tourism which deals with the general aspect of Tourism, BS in Tourism Management focuses on the corporate and administrative side of the Tourism Industry, particularly proficiency in working on and eventually operating a Tour-providing Company. This course is very much related to BS in Travel Management, which concentrates on skills for working in Travel agencies. Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management The Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM) program is geared towards equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and attitude to provide quality service in the hospitality industry. The program contains subjects that will address the needs of different sectors in the hospitality industry, such as culinary, front office, tourism, resort and hotel operations. Its primary concentration is on the development of practical and management skills which are achieved through the combination of theoretical classes, practicum exercises and experiential learning. Graduates of this course will possess business management and accounting skills to be able to compute daily sales, recipe costing/cost control and inventory management. The program also helps students to develop effective communication and interpersonal skills which are essential in establishing positive employer/employee/customer relations.

The first school building consisting of four floors (the present hospital) was constructed in a remarkable\n          record-breaking period of only four months, which ordinarily takes one year to construct. The school building\n          was created to house the College of Nursing. Around 700 nursing student were enrolled and a few were referrals\n          from the Perpetual Help School in Manila. Perpetual was indeed on its way to becoming a premier university\n          south of Metro Manila. The organizational structure of the former Perpetual Help College of Rizal has interwoven within its fabric a\n          closely-knit group of administrators and educators. The administrative expertise of Mr. Crisostomo, the\n          educational and supervisory proficiency of former Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila acting President and the\n          Perpetual – Biñan First Chancellor Benjamin L.

Moran, father of Dr. Daisy, a Certified Public Accountant and former President of the\n          Continental Bank, facilitated the needed funds of the project through his friends and the Development Bank of\n          the Philippines, where he served as its first manager of branches and agencies. Mission The University of Perpetual Help System is dedicated to the development of the Filipino as a leader. It aims\n          to graduate dynamic students who are physically, intellectually, socially, and spiritually committed to the\n          achievement of the best quality of life.

Ramones MIT College of Business and Accountancy Programs Offered Bachelor of Science in Business Administration major in Management Bachelor of Science in Business Administration major in Business Management (BSBA-M), also known as BSBA in Business Management, is a four year degree program designed to equip students with the concepts and principles of Business Management. The BSBA in Management program teaches students operations and processes that occur within an organization such as procurement, logistics, quality control, project management, manufacturing and marketing. The BSBA-M program is more specific compared to the generic BSBA curriculum, and focuses on the more authoritative aspects of business like planning business activities, organizing departments and employees, running departments, and generally managing an organization. Bachelor of Science in Accountancy The Bachelor of Science in Accountancy (BSA) program is composed of subjects in accounting (financial, public, managerial), audit, administration, business laws and taxation. Its primary focus is not limited to business subjects, but to other fields as well, such as banking and finance, government, social services, education, and more. The program also teaches students to integrate information technology concepts into business systems, in order to create a more systematic and organized way of storing business related data. As a student, you will be taught computerized accounting systems, and basic understanding of computer programming and auditing systems. The program also instills in students the importance of computational and communication skills both in written and oral English. The BS Accounting program is taught in a variety of teaching methods such as case analysis, individual and group reports, simulations, classroom discussions and guest lecturers. It also includes extensive exposures to business immersions (an internship where there is a probability that the company will hire/absorb you after graduation) and an on-the-job training that will provide you with the understanding of practical accountancy.

College of International Hospitality Management Programs Offered Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management is a four-year college course recommended for people who wants to have a career in the field of Tourism and Event Management. This course leads to expertise in management of tour-operating agencies, as well as other jobs in the tourism and hospitality sector. The BS in Tourism Management course consists of several CHED-mandated general subjects, while the focus of the study is on the administrative aspect of Tour Operating business, particularly entrepreneurship and trade planning. The curriculum also includes operational competencies, event management classes, investment, market study and more. The combination of theories learned inside the classroom and on-the-job training will prepare the students to be globally competitive in tourism management operations. In comparison with BS in Tourism which deals with the general aspect of Tourism, BS in Tourism Management focuses on the corporate and administrative side of the Tourism Industry, particularly proficiency in working on and eventually operating a Tour-providing Company. This course is very much related to BS in Travel Management, which concentrates on skills for working in Travel agencies. Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management The Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM) program is geared towards equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and attitude to provide quality service in the hospitality industry. The program contains subjects that will address the needs of different sectors in the hospitality industry, such as culinary, front office, tourism, resort and hotel operations. Its primary concentration is on the development of practical and management skills which are achieved through the combination of theoretical classes, practicum exercises and experiential learning. Graduates of this course will possess business management and accounting skills to be able to compute daily sales, recipe costing/cost control and inventory management. The program also helps students to develop effective communication and interpersonal skills which are essential in establishing positive employer/employee/customer relations.

The first school building consisting of four floors (the present hospital) was constructed in a remarkable\n          record-breaking period of only four months, which ordinarily takes one year to construct. The school building\n          was created to house the College of Nursing. Around 700 nursing student were enrolled and a few were referrals\n          from the Perpetual Help School in Manila. Perpetual was indeed on its way to becoming a premier university\n          south of Metro Manila. The organizational structure of the former Perpetual Help College of Rizal has interwoven within its fabric a\n          closely-knit group of administrators and educators.
